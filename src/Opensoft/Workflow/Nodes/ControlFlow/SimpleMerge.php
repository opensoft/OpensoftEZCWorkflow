/**
 * This node implements the Simple Merge (XOR-Join) workflow pattern.
 *
 * The Simple Merge workflow pattern is to be used to merge the possible paths that are defined
 * by a preceding Exclusive Choice. It is assumed that of these possible paths exactly one is
 * taken and no synchronization takes place.
 *
 * Use Case Example: After the payment has been performed by either credit card or bank
 * transfer, the order can be processed further.
 *
 * Incoming nodes: 2..*
 * Outgoing nodes: 1
 *
 * This example displays how you can use a simple merge to tie together two different
 * execution paths from an exclusive choice into one.
 *
 * <code>
 * <?php
 * $workflow = new Workflow( 'Test' );
 *
 * // wait for input into the workflow variable value.
 * $input = new Input( array( 'value' => new ezcWorkflowConditionIsInt ) );
 * $workflow->startNode->addOutNode( $input );
 *
 * // create the exclusive choice branching node
 * $choice = new ExclusiveChoice;
 * $intput->addOutNode( $choice );
 *
 * $branch1 = ....; // create nodes for the first branch of execution here..
 * $branch2 = ....; // create nodes for the second branch of execution here..
 *
 * // add the outnodes and set the conditions on the exclusive choice
 * $choice->addConditionalOutNode( new Variable( 'value',
 *                                                                  new ezcWorkflowConditionGreatherThan( 10 ) ),
