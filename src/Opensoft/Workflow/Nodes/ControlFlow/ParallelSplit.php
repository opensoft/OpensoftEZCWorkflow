/**
 * This node implements the Parallel Split workflow pattern.
 *
 * The Parallel Split workflow pattern divides one thread of execution
 * unconditionally into multiple parallel threads of execution.
 *
 * Use Case Example: After the credit card specified by the customer has been successfully
 * charged, the activities of sending a confirmation email and starting the shipping process can
 * be executed in parallel.
 *
 * Incoming nodes: 1
 * Outgoing nodes: 2..*
 *
 * This example creates a workflow that splits in two parallel threads which
 * are joined again using a Discriminator.
 *
 * <code>
 * <?php
 * $workflow = new Workflow( 'Test' );
 *
 * $split = new ParallelSplit();
 * $workflow->startNode->addOutNode( $split );
 * $nodeExec1 = ....; // create nodes for the first thread of execution here..
 * $nodeExec2 = ....; // create nodes for the second thread of execution here..
 *
 * $disc = new Discriminator();
 * $disc->addInNode( $nodeExec1 );
 * $disc->addInNode( $nodeExec2 );
 * $disc->addOutNode( $workflow->endNode );
 * ?>
