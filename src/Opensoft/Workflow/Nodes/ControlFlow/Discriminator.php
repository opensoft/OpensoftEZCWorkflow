/**
 * This node implements the Discriminator workflow pattern.
 *
 * The Discriminator workflow pattern can be applied when the assumption made for the
 * Simple Merge workflow pattern does not hold. It can deal with merge situations where multiple
 * incoming branches may run in parallel.
 * It activates its outgoing node after being activated by the first incoming branch and then waits
 * for all remaining branches to complete before it resets itself. After the reset the Discriminator
 * can be triggered again.
 *
 * Use Case Example: To improve response time, an action is delegated to several distributed
 * servers. The first response proceeds the flow, the other responses are ignored.
 *
 * Incoming nodes: 2..*
 * Outgoing nodes: 1
 *
 * This example creates a workflow that splits in two parallel threads which
 * are joined again using a Discriminator.
 *
 * <code>
 * <?php
 * $workflow = new Workflow( 'Test' );
 *
 * $split = new ParallelSplit();
 * $workflow->startNode->addOutNode( $split );
 * $nodeExec1 = ....; // create nodes for the first thread of execution here..
 * $nodeExec2 = ....; // create nodes for the second thread of execution here..
 *
 * $disc = new Discriminator();
 * $disc->addInNode( $nodeExec1 );
 * $disc->addInNode( $nodeExec2 );
 * $disc->addOutNode( $workflow->endNode );
 * ?>
 * </code>
