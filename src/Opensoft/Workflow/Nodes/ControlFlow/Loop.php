 * The Loop node type is a special type of conditional branch node that has two
 * incoming nodes instead of just one. It is used to conveniently express loops.
 *
 * Incoming nodes: 2..*
 * Outgoing nodes: 2..*
 *
 * The example below shows the equivalent of a for-loop that iterates the
 * variable i from 1 to 10:
 *
 * <code>
 * <?php
 * $workflow = new Workflow( 'IncrementingLoop' );
 *
 * $set      = new Set( array( 'i' => 1 ) );
 * $step     = new Increment( 'i' );
 * $break    = new Variable( 'i', new ezcWorkflowConditionIsEqual( 10 ) );
 * $continue = new Variable( 'i', new IsLessThan( 10 ) );
 *
 * $workflow->startNode->addOutNode( $set );
 *
 * $loop = new Loop;
 * $loop->addInNode( $set );
 * $loop->addInNode( $step );
 *
 * $loop->addConditionalOutNode( $continue, $step );
 * $loop->addConditionalOutNode( $break, $workflow->endNode );
 * ?>
